The accent of this project was developing the architecture of the chosen task. We worked in a team of two and I was satisfied with the cohesion. Even though the other team member would only pay attention to the project very close to the phase deadlines, I had full faith in him since we know each other well, and I was 100% confident he would do his part without me nagging him at all.

At the time of writing this description, we have successfully defended our project but haven't been given a mark for our work yet.
